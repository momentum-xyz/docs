# What is Odyssey?
*Odyssey is the place where our imaginations meet to co-create, connect, and tokenise adventures, quests, and journeys.*

But what does that mean exactly? The goal of Odyssey is to empower you to discover the deeper parts of yourself, of your *innerverse*, and share this epic quest of discovery with whomever you like. More than that, you can turn that into *real value*. We provide the tools, the platform, and the network. You provide the insights, the inspiration, and the passion. Together, we create something unique that lives and evolves on the blockchain, and is completely owned by you.

Welcome to Odyssey, the *Web3 social medium for co-creation*. Welcome to *your* Odyssey. We are so glad to have you on board!
## What is a Social Medium?
We see a Social Medium as the next iteration of Web 2.0 platforms, tools, and social networks. It’s your infinite 3D space where you can manifest, represent, and imagine anything—and best of all you own it! Something that is not based on just your external appearance and the image society demands you project, but on your real self. A social medium lets you take the most epic parts of your inner being and use them (if you wish) to produce value that others can interact with and learn from. *You don’t just feed data and content into the machine, you build the machine and make it run and work for you*.
## What are inner and outer worlds?
We all are the combination of an inner world and an outer world—or an *innerverse* and an *outerverse* if you like. You can visualise it as your person, there are two sides of you:
- The way you *appear* (e.g., the clothes you wear, your haircut, the thoughts you express, the way you move, etc.)
- The way you *are* (e.g., what happens in your mind, and you don’t know how to or feel like sharing, or even the things that go on beyond your consciousness, things that you feel, but there is currently no way to express online)

Web2 tools wonderfully allow you to share your outerverse: bios, profile pics, tweets, posts, you name it. But what about your innerverse? That is *the largest and most beautiful part of you*, and we believe that you should be able to embark on a journey to explore and visualise it and share it with whomever you want.
## Overview
To put it simply, an Odyssey is your *innerverse*. A place to visually express your emotions, thoughts, ideas, interest and anything that is part of you. You can build and create the content you want, and the content belongs to you and always will, thanks to the blockchain.

By signing up and minting your Odyssey NFT with the Momentum ($MTM) token (don’t worry, we’ll give you some for free as a thank you for exploring the very early stages of the product), you will create an infinite space of your own, where you can place and share anything, from your NFT collection, to your random thoughts when you go on that awesome tangent (you know the one we are talking about!). We provide the tools to let you fill your Odyssey with what you want (a lot more tools are in the making, see [Roadmap](what-is-odyssey/roadmap)).
## Where did the idea come from?
This is how we came up with Odyssey as you see it now, head to the about us page to find out how we got here.

On October 19th 2022, during one of our lively discussions concerning the metaverse an idea was suggested. A simple idea, but one that really resonated with us. Every metaverse (and social network) out there currently focuses on the external, the apparent—be it land, art, branding, or personal image. What if the emphasis of the metaverse was more personal? What if a metaverse was about you? A 3D space telling the living, breathing, evolving epic journey you are on. Your *Odyssey*. 

We believe that every life has a powerful narrative and every story deserves to be told. What if these journeys could be built in a 3D environment, shared and experienced by others? What if you could capture the defining moments of your Odyssey in a decentralised manner, knowing that your journey will live forever on the blockchain? Would be pretty cool, right?  

We’ve seen the effect NFTs have had as personal profile pictures. But what if your PFP (profile picture) was more than some awesome artwork—what if it was the very journey you are on? Your digital living profile, a constantly evolving story of you, your loves, your hates, and your interests. Your connections and friends, all forming a digital, interconnected network of Odysseys that spreads around the world.

We discussed this concept intensely internally. Incredibly powerful and passionate arguments from producers, developers, and founders—concerning very abstract concepts such as the definition of self, the way we present ourselves online and what a journey really is. We soon realised that the idea of the Odyssey had taken root in the company.

Two weeks later, the entire company assembled and pivoted to make this idea a reality.

What you are seeing now are the results of that pivot. You are now part of our journey, and we are now part of yours.

Welcome to Odyssey!
