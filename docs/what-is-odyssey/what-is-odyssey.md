# Getting started with Odyssey

Welcome to Odyssey’s docs. This page will give you a quick overview of why we built Odyssey, what it does, and what is our vision for it.

On the left, you can quickly navigate to the sections that interest you the most:
- Create your Odyssey (user-centric documentation on all the functionalities)
- Build (developer-centric documentation)

Odyssey is supported by:

## What is Odyssey?

Odyssey is a web 3D social medium for novel metaverse experiences.

If we wanted to define Odyssey one step further, one could say that it is your personal metaverse, where you can build experiences that would be impossible otherwise. Go to Use cases to learn more.

## Why Odyssey?

In a sentence, to create experiences that wouldn’t be possible, either online or offline.

We believe that the metaverse, with its added third dimension and “physical presence”, give the opportunity to create unprecedented cooperative experiences.

> We are the sum total of our experiences—B.J. Neblett

So, why not enhance our experiences, together?

## What can I do with Odyssey?

You can accomplish three things:

1- Build your own 3D world, with custom assets and functionalities.
2- Generate, program, and participate in unique collaborative experiences
3- Leverage the power of tokenomics to earn from your creations, and support your network of Connections (our implementation of staking)

We enable these via three pillars:

1- The Odyssey Creator (a 3D world builder, not dissimilar to what you find in MMORPGs like Minecraft)
2- A plugin infrastructure
3- The Momentum ($MOM) token

Let’s quickly see an overview of all three.

### Odyssey Creator

A multiplayer game-style world builder that allows you to place objects (both default and custom) in your Odyssey. You can also change the skybox (the backdrop of your Odyssey, which controls the vibe of your world); custom skyboxes are coming soon.

The builder has all the standard features such as move, scale, and rotate. In addition, you can assign each object a specific functionality (e.g. connect a Miro board, a Google document, text).

### Plugin infrastructure

Odyssey is open-source, and we are implementing a plugin infrastructure to let everyone create the functionalities they need (think of it as WordPress plugins for your metaverse).

The power of the plugins is twofold:

1- Creators will gain tailored functionalities to create even more unique experiences, hence attracting more people
2- Developers will be able to create value for the community, while implementing their own earning mechanisms (e.g. tip-based, subscription, a fee per usage, one-time fee, etc.)

### Momentum token

$MOM (Momentum) is a **utility token** used both for paying network fees (e.g. minting your Odyssey) and for connecting to other Odyssey—our implementation of staking which yields both the staker and the stakee. Read more about $MOM further down.

### Collaboration tools

In addition to the three pillars above, Odyssey comes with built-in collaboration tools to host your events and unleash your creative powers.

- Calendar (schedule events and allow users to pop them in their Google or iCal)
- Voice and text chat
- Screen sharing

## How do you interact with Odyssey?

Odyssey gives you freedom of action. There are many ways to interact with your Odyssey and the Odysseys of others:

- Build your Odyssey, fill it with your creations
- Organise events and experiences by leveraging the collaboration tools
- Connect (aka stake) in the Odyssey of your favourite creators and get rewarded with $MOM
- Participate in events created by other users and help co-create new experiences

## What is the Momentum Token?

We already said that Momentum is the native token of Odyssey, which will serve as a utility token to mint and have full ownership of your metaverse, as well as for fees and rewards.

Our vision encompasses other uses of $MOM, such as:

- **Tokenised business model** by token-gating specific sections/objects within your Odyssey (e.g. allowing access to token-holders only, or using token as tickets for events, collecting subscriptions, membership fees, etc.)
- **Tokenisation** of plugins and other assets
- **Native token**, with which you can mint your own community tokens (i.e. tokens specific to your Odyssey)
- **On-chain social networks**, by connecting on-chain through staking

## Some use cases

**You are an NFT artist**. Display your artwork in a 3D environment, hold auctions, sell your work both within the Odyssey and outside. More than that, hold events and gatherings for art enthusiasts, or even events where you co-create unique art pieces with other artists (for example, through a plugin that integrates Magma, just like we integrated Miro).

**You are in a band**. You can live cast your gig in your Odyssey, and let thousands of people that cannot be there in person enjoy your concert, but also participate by posting pictures, or interact with you via voice chat. With the right implementation, even experience the show with VR. After the concert, you could give access to the recording through your community token, or even mint your formidable guitar solo for your fans to hold as an NFT.

## How do I get started with Odyssey?

Odyssey is currently on testnet, and you can go to [odyssey.org](https://odyssey.org) to create your own Odyssey right now. All you need is a Polkadot-compatible wallet (at the moment, we recommend Polkadot.JS).

Here are a few useful links:

## Brief history of Odyssey

These are some pivotal points in the history of Odyssey, which help understand what made the blossoming of our current vision possible.

Odyssey started by organising the largest in-person blockchain hackathons in Europe. When Covid-19 didn’t allow us to do the physical hackathon, we pivoted by creating an online 3D world inspired by MMORPGs to host our hackathons, as no other tool could get the job done. We successfully hosted hackathons with up to 2500 participants simultaneously in one world. Only after our hackathon, we learned about the term Metaverse, and then understood that that was what we were building. 


After client collaborations (with, amongst others, the Dutch Ministry of Interior, Vattenfall, Sovereign Nature Initiative and the Kusama network), we are now at a stage where everyone can create their own 3D world, without being confined to land in a metaverse; a world with its own tokenomics, looks, and functionality. 

We have always been a community based organisation building bridges with the web3 world. We therefore also develop our stack in public and with users together.
