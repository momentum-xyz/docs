## What is Odyssey?

Content creation, collaboration, and community building in 3D.

We enable creators eager to explore the digital format of 3D with intuitive interface & processes to craft and publish interactive 3D experiences in browser, together, as these stories unfold so we share knowledge networks and skills.


## Why Odyssey?

1. Accessible: No coding skills required to create content in 3D
 
2. Social: encourages sharing, collaborating, and 
connecting with others

3. User-generated and curated: Users actively create and curate content and earn with it

## What can I do with Odyssey?

You can accomplish three things:

1- Build your own 3D world, with custom assets and functionalities.
2- Generate, program, and participate in unique collaborative experiences
3- Leverage the power of tokenomics to earn from your creations, and support your network of Connections (our implementation of staking)

We enable these via three pillars:

1- The Odyssey Creator (a 3D world builder, not dissimilar to what you find in MMORPGs like Minecraft)
2- A plugin infrastructure
3- The Momentum ($MOM) token

Let‚Äôs quickly see an overview of all three.

### Odyssey Creator

A multiplayer game-style world builder that allows you to place objects (both default and custom) in your Odyssey. You can also change the skybox (the backdrop of your Odyssey, which controls the vibe of your world); custom skyboxes are coming soon.

The builder has all the standard features such as move, scale, and rotate. In addition, you can assign each object a specific functionality (e.g. connect a Miro board, a Google document, text).

### Plugin infrastructure

Odyssey is open-source, and we are implementing a plugin infrastructure to let everyone create the functionalities they need (think of it as WordPress plugins for your metaverse).

The power of the plugins is twofold:

1- Creators will gain tailored functionalities to create even more unique experiences, hence attracting more people
2- Developers will be able to create value for the community, while implementing their own earning mechanisms (e.g. tip-based, subscription, a fee per usage, one-time fee, etc.)

### Momentum token

$MOM (Momentum) is a **utility token** used both for paying network fees (e.g. minting your Odyssey) and for connecting to other Odyssey‚Äîour implementation of staking which yields both the staker and the stakee. Read more about $MOM further down.

### Collaboration tools

In addition to the three pillars above, Odyssey comes with built-in collaboration tools to host your events and unleash your creative powers.

- Calendar (schedule events and allow users to pop them in their Google or iCal)
- Voice and text chat
- Screen sharing

## How do you interact with Odyssey?

Odyssey gives you freedom of action. There are many ways to interact with your Odyssey and the Odysseys of others:

- Build your Odyssey, fill it with your creations
- Organise events and experiences by leveraging the collaboration tools
- Connect (aka stake) in the Odyssey of your favourite creators and get rewarded with $MOM
- Participate in events created by other users and help co-create new experiences

## How do I get started with Odyssey?

Odyssey is currently on testnet, and you can go to [odyssey.org](https://odyssey.org) to create your own Odyssey right now. All you need is a Polkadot-compatible wallet (at the moment, we recommend Polkadot.JS).
