# Roadmap
At Odysset we don't have a roadmap like one normally encounters in other companies. We have a map (aka a set of destinations that we would like to reach), and we are sure there is a road in front of us.

Neveretheless, you—the user—will determine which places on the map we will visit first, which features we will realease. Your feedback, participation, and opinions are fundamental in the development of Odyssey, and we want your voice to be heard.
## How to let us know what features you need
