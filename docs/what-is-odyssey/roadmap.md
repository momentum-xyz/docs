At Odyssey we don't have a roadmap like one normally encounters in other companies. We have a map (aka a set of destinations that we would like to reach), and we are sure there is a road in front of us.

Nevertheless, you‚Äîthe user‚Äîwill determine which places on the map we will visit first, which features we will release. Your feedback, participation, and opinions are fundamental in the development of Odyssey, and we want your voice to be heard.

This is a very humble beginning for Odyssey. We have hacked a pre-alpha version in under a month, and we have this MLP (Minimum Loveable Product! üòù) for you to play with. We are very excited to see what you will do with it! We are impatient to hear your feedback and all about what you need to embark on your Odyssey. In the meantime, here is what‚Äôs coming from our side.
## Staking
`Status: in development`

Found some content you really love? Do you know a creator who you really want to promote? You can directly support them by staking the Momentum token ($MTM) into their Odyssey! By staking $MTM into an Odyssey, you are directly supporting the creator. Even cooler, by staking $MTM, you regularly get a percentage of the $MTM you staked as a reward. Gain more $MTM just by supporting others? How cool is that?

When staking in an Odyssey, you have the option to *Reinvest* your rewards into this Odyssey meaning that rather than getting regular rewards over time, all the rewards are automatically added to your stake into that Odyssey, showing your ever-increasing support for that content. 

The wonderful thing about staking is that it actively contributes to the health of everyone‚Äôs Odysseys‚Äîstaking rewards not only go to you, but to the creator of the Odyssey you are hosting as well as to the node owners (the owners of the hardware the Odyssey is running on).

Finally, as you may stake onto others, others may stake onto you. In other words, you too can be rewarded for the content you create!
## Plugins
`Status: in development`

All functionality within your Odyssey is powered through a system of plugins. Our major goal is to let others develop plugins for the stack. We will be releasing full documentation and examples to help developers build plugins. Also, plugins will be part of the MOMENTUM network‚Äîmeaning that developers can earn from their plugins. Stay tuned for more info!
## Extended creation tools
`Status: scoping`

We will be adding new tools and ways of building your Odyssey **code-free**. Our aim is to allow *everyone* to create their perfect vision of their Odyssey, independently of their technical knowledge: whatever your skill, whatever your journey, we want you to be a part of this!
## Decentralisation
Currently, all content is hosted on our servers, which is the very opposite direction we want to go! We believe in Web 3.0, and we promised that you will be the owner of anything you create. In the coming months, we will be moving to a decentralised hosting solution‚Äîallowing anyone to run their Odyssey node(s) on their own hardware. For this is the Web3 way!<br />
