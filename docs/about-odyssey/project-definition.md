# Project definition template

How to start, collaborate and complete projects in Odyssey?

First, define what is a project?

It is either something new (not a repeatable or regular task) or something that takes more than 16 hours in total effort. If your project falls under this project definition, create a project document describing your idea/ need on Nifty: https://momentum.nifty.pm/

Then answer the first 3 questions:
1. GOAL
2. TRACK
3. PRIORITY

See the full project definition template here:
