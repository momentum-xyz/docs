On this page we collect the new features, fixes, and changes pushed to production with every release. The notes start from the release of Odyssey Alpha (0.24) and are grouped by version number starting from the most recent.

## 0.24 2023-02-07

### New

- Custom skyboxes. You can now upload your own skybox, they will be private and not shared with other users. See instructions [here](/explore-the-features/odyssey-creator/change-skybox.md#how-to-change-the-skybox).
- Support for Vimeo and Twitch. Now the `video` functionality supports Vimeo and Twitch links, in addition to YouTube.
- Newly minted Odysseys are not empty anymore: they contain basic assets, staking tutorial, and a docking station to help users get started.
- Colour picker for objects. Users can now choose the colour of basic assets.
- Search assets. There is now a search bar in the asset library for finding objects quickly.
- New basic assets. We have added some fun new assets that are available to everyone, and are different from standard geometric shapes. You can access them in `Asset Spawn` menu under `Standard Asset Pack` 
- Text functionality has been improved with multi-line text. Now, if you assign the `Text` functionality to an object, you will be presented with a multi-line text box.
- Clicking on a wisp shows the user's profile. If you now click on a wisp (the little dot of light that represent a user and flies around), the owner's profile is shown.

### Fixes

- Previews are now available for all objects, not just custom ones.
- Object previous are shown for all objects, not just the one that's hovered.
- Fixed account balance calculations. Now Total and Transferable balances are correct
- Visitor don't have to log in or identify themselves anymore. Anyone can now explore existing Odysseys, see a Odyssey's calendar, use voice and text chat, and high-five other users without having to create an account.
- Fixed issue where the wrong profile icon was displayed in the list of online users.
