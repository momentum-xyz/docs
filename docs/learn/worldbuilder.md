Ever since the [inception](what-is.md#odyssey-momentum) of the Momentum Stack it has been designed to support multiple worlds. With the Worldbuilder we will unleash this functionality - allowing anyone to create a metaverse while having an epic experience at the same time.

# The Worldbuilder Hierarchy

A metaverse is born when a  node owner installs and configures the Momentum Stack on their hardware. At this point, the node owner can also install any number of plugins at the node level which will enable functionalities in the worlds that are created on this node. The node owner can also whitelist accounts (or distribute a token) to allow those accounts to create a world on their node.

A world owner can start creating their world right away, using a simple web interface to initialise and create their world. At this point, they can name their world, select a default template to style and populate their world, as well as enable/disable any plugins they want running in their world. Once this process is complete, the world owner can enter their newly spawned world.

Once the world owner has entered their world, they will notice a new button on their UI - the "build" button. Clicking this button will allow the world owner to start customising the look, feel and functionalities of their world. It should be noted, that in a similar fashion to the node owner, a world owner can whitelist/distribute a token that would allow any account access to this "build" button in this world. The world can be further customised by the world owner adding User Generated Content (UGC) to their world.

User Generated Content can be created by anyone, and is a collection of resources, configurations and plugins that when combined will allow for simple integration of new content (and functionalities) inside a world. This UGC can be turned into a NFT and sold, as well as given away for free. UGC is a fractionalised NFT - meaning that content creators that contributed to the UGC are rewarded for their content automatically.


# The Worldbuilder Components

The Worldbuilder project consists of three distinct parts, with each part collectively being part of the Worldbuilder experience.

## The Drive token

The Drive token is a decentralised social network - allowing people to connect, earn and collaborate together within the metaverse. This token will allow for different worlds to be connected together, allowing seamless transport between them.

## Plug-in infrastructure

Installed at the node level, plug-ins provide the backbone to power the different aspects of a world. A plug-in can be as simple as a dashboard integration (for instance, enabling Miro on platforms) or as complex as a space simulation game. World owners can enable these during the configuration of the world, as well as being able dynamically enable and disable these plugins when their world is running.

## The Worldbuilder

The Worldbuilder itself allows for the creation and customisation of a world. Designed to be a collaborative and epic experience, the Worldbuilder will empower anyone to be able to create their own world without writing a single line of code. 

# Development Status

The Worldbuilder project is under constant development, and the information below is subject to change, however, the different stages of the development of the Worldbuilder is listed below:

* __The Worldbuilder MVP__ (done!)- Our first step to unleashing the worldbuilder. A very simple interface that will create and start a world after choosing a few options. This took a very arduous manual process of setting up template files, databases and services into an automatic process that takes less than a minute to set up a world.

* __The Worldbuilder Configurator__ (in progress!) - With worlds created, it’s no point if they all look the same, this configurator will allow a world owner to customise skyboxes, spawn points and platforms. Platform customisbility will include which integrations are run inside the platform dashboard, as well as the 3d asset used for the platform along with how the dashboard will appear. 

* __The Worldbuilder Configurator Unleashed__ (coming soon!) - There are a lot of backend features that we’ve developed since 2020 that currently have no way of being accessed without diving into a database/template files - things like unique platform colours, soundtracks, which player controller to use, totems and other cosmetics. With this project we aim to unlock all these things, so that a world owner can unleash the power of these functionalities.
