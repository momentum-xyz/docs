# WTF is Momentum?

Hello world!

Momentum is software technology used to build browser based 3D worlds without physical restraints and *with* utility, enabling collective online and on-chain activities in a massively multiplayer setting.

Originated in 2020 to solve our own problem: hosting the 4th annual 48-hour Odyssey Hackathon with 3000 participants from 60 countries. Because of covid, this couldn’t happen physically. So we’ve built our own Online Mass Collaboration Arena.
