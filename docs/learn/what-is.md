# What is Momentum?

Momentum is software stack used to build browser based 3D worlds without physical restraints and *with* utility, enabling collective online and on-chain activities in a massively multiplayer setting.

Originated in 2020 to solve our own problem: hosting the 4th annual 48-hour Odyssey Hackathon with 3000 participants from 60 countries. Because of COVID, this couldn’t happen physically. So we built our own Online Mass Collaboration Arena.

### How did we end up here?

In 2016, we started as the Dutch Blockchain Hackathon and organized the first Dutch Blockchain Hackathon, attended by 55 teams, 350 participants, 100 Jedi, and was supported by 50 volunteers. 

The Hackathon was part of a program that consisted of three phases: preparation, hackathon, acceleration.

### Dutch Blockchain Hackathon 2016-2017

Here we hosted 5 challenges of partners like The Dutch Chamber of Commerce, APG (largest Dutch pension provider), and The Dutch Authority for Identity.

### Blockchaingers Hackathon

In 2018, we organized our second, larger and growing hackathon, the Blockchaingers Hackathon. 63 teams working on 7 challenges.

### Blockathon

In 2018 we organized the Blockathon with the European Commission, The European Union Intellectual Property Office, together with Deloitte and Bencom Group. Here 11 curated teams worked together with EC, EUIPO, and experts from the field from Alibaba, KML/ Airfrance, Chanel, and many more to build the next level anti-counterfeiting infrastructure. 

The winning solution of Cryptomice is currently being build together with EUIPO and an industry consortium.

### Odyssey Hackathon 2019

In 2019, we organized the last physical Odyssey Hackathon, where 100 teams participated in 20 challenges.

### Odyssey Momentum

In 2020, due to COVID we were forced to host the hackathon online. When we couldn’t find a fitting solution or tool to create an epic online hack in, we decided to build something ourselves. So we changed gears and dimensions and inspired by (amongst many other things) EVE online, we set out sail to build Momentum. 

In November 2020 we hosted the 4th annual 48-hour Odyssey Hackathon with 3000 participants from 60 countries. We had built our own Online Mass Collaboration Arena.

Within three months we built the very first version of Momentum, which went live in on November 15, 2020 during Odyssey Momentum (the first digital Odyssey Hackathon). During the hackathon we hosted 1600 people simultaneously in the same space, collaborating with experts.

### Developing Momentum further

After successfully hosting the Odyssey Hackathon online with Momentum, we chose to further develop the stack that we created. During the hackathon we understood the core utility and the foundation of our purpose. We supported the befriended company Bencom to host their company hackathon in Momentum.

During 2021 we experimented with a variety of clients for whom we build custom 3D worlds in which they hosted hackathons, gave classes, or hosted innovation competitions. Examples of client worlds we have built and are live: 

- Dutch Ministry of interior world, built to enable cross ministerial collaboration with various societal stakeholder: [https://watwerktvoorons.odyssey.org/](https://watwerktvoorons.odyssey.org/)
- Vattenfall world, built to host their innovation competition: [https://fossilfreefuture.odyssey.org/](https://fossilfreefuture.odyssey.org/login)
- The Royal Netherlands Standardization Institute hosted an innovation hackathon in their dedicated world: [https://nen.odyssey.org/](https://nen.odyssey.org/)
- Digicampus held their digital hackathon here: [https://digicampus.odyssey.org/](https://digicampus.odyssey.org/)

After feeling a good click with SNI, a week in Lisbon on a DAO conference, we explored the avenues of building for Web3. We dove into a rabbit hole of DAOs, NFT communities and crypto infrastructures during the epic internal [Odyssey Hackathon 2021](https://www.notion.so/Odyssey-Hackathon-2021-43a45e24ecf0477e8328cc40685ba8fe). We realized we could show a different and valuable approach to what the metaverse can be and understood our product base. We decided to pivot and fully focus on building with and for the DOTSAMA ecosystem.

### Igniting the Kusamaverse

When we felt a click with the DOTSAMA ecosystem, we went head first into building the Kusamaverse. We wrote a proposal for the Kusama treasury, which got approved. We officially delivered Milestone 1 on May 11, 2022.

Within 3 months we delivered the community base of the Kusamaverse: https://kusama.momentum.xyz/
