# Meeting design

Odyssey is building Momentum. Momentum is an online public space to meet, connect, create and to have fun. To build Momentum we are meeting. To be able to build, meetings should be effective, thriving and… leave as much time as possible to build, AKA get work / magic done. This document is a recipe book to get more out of remote meetings in less time. It is a hitchhiker's guide to thriving gatherings.

At Odyssey we see meetings as tools. To put a screw in a plank a screwdriver (or cordless drilling machine) is the way to go, whilst a hammer (or tacker) is better with nails. And to cheer up a crowd a flute, guitar or sampling station is the best option. So pick or create the best tool for each job. And if you don’t need a tool (anymore), don’t use it, pick another, drop it or keep your hands and mind empty to be able to applause – for example. So: not meeting is the standard, each and every meeting is a conscious choice.

**Checklist – too short summary**

Does your invitation contain?
1. Inviting, meaningful title.
2. Goal
3. Desired result / follow-up
4. Role of every participant in achieving this result.
5. What will happen next (with the result)?
6. Times. Doors open, start, finish, doors closed.
7. Location / URL and tools being used.

**And check:**
1. Is the meeting really necessary? 
2. Do you need help to prepare or chair the meeting? Great! Get in Ritzo and/or Nick!

**Why do I want to gather which people?**
1. Designing a meeting always starts with two interrelated questions:
2. Why do we need to meet?
3. Who do we really need? (Names and numbers and/or their ‘species’ / role).
