# How we work together

Weâ€™re building the Momentum stack in public! This means that:

1. Everything is transparent

Our processes are public, our code is open-source, all our documents are public and our meetings are held in public (in the [Kusamaverse](https://kusama.momentum.xyz/magic/16b49508-53db-428f-a399-069745e54f9b).

2. We are a project driven organisation

For us, the project is the primary unit for achieving results

3. Show and tell

Once a week, all projects present their progress, #wins and cockups for everyone's questions, tips and help. Again, this event if open to the public. If you'd like to join them, please add this link to your agenda: https://bit.ly/3KJ6Kyo
