# How we work together

Weâ€™re building the Momentum stack in public: this means that:

1. Everything is transparent
Our processes are public, our code is open-source, all our documents are public, our meetings are public (in the Kusamaverse) unless there is a really good reason not to.

2. We are a project driven organisation
For us, the project is the primary unit for achieving results

3. Show and tell
Once a week, all projects present their progress, #wins and cockups for everyone's questions, tips and help. Again, open to the public:)
