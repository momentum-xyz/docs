# Get a wallet

Odyssey is build on web3 technology, which means that you need a wallet to access the full Odyssey experience.

Right now, we support MetaMask, Coinbase and Talisman wallets, available as a browser extension. Instructions on how to set up one of these wallets you can find below.

## Set up your MetaMask wallet

### 1. Download the wallet extension

Go to MetaMask.io on a supported browser (Chrome, Firefox, Brave or Edge).

For example, the Chrome browser.

Click on “Download” or “Download now” on the page.

Click on “Install MetaMask for Chrome”.
