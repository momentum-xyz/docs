# Create your Odyssey
When you mint your Odyssey, we provide you a starting platform to play with—don’t worry, you can always get rid of it later! (If you are a developer, and you want to tinker with code, see the Build section 🧑‍💻).
## How to create your Odyssey
Currently, Odyssey is in pre-alpha release on testnet. This means that we will give you some Momentum ($MTM) tokens to mint your Odyssey as an NFT and to play around with. As we gather feedback from you, we'll add features and gradually more to production (if you want to know more, you can check the [release notes](/what-is-odyssey/release-notes)).

In order to get started to need to follow these steps:
1. Make sure you have a Polkadot.Js wallet
2. Mint your Odyssey as an NFT
3. Done 🥳
