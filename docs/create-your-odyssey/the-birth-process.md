# The birth process

In order to start creating and expressing yourself in your own unique space, you need to give *birth* to it. Don't worry, it's not nearly as hard as it sounds!

## 1. Start the birth process

To start creating your own Odyssey's NFT, simply click on `Create your Odyssey`

## 3. Choose an image and an epic name

How are you going to name your Odyssey? What will be the first image people will see? That's up to you :blush:

## 4. Be patient...

It might take a little while for your Odyssey to be created (it's a *whole* world after all!), so please hang on and don't refresh your browser!
