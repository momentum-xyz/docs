In this section we give an overview of all the feature you can use to create and co-create your unique, epic Odyssey.

## Terminology

Before you dive deeper into Odyssey and the features there are some main concepts you need to be familiar with:

- **Odyssey**. This is your inner world representation in the metaverse
- **Odyssey Creator**. It's your source of power, you will head hear anytime you want to add something to your Odyssey
- **Objects**. These are the assets that make up your Odyssey, we give you some to get started with, but you can also import your own!
- **Joint Odysseys**. A Joint Odyssey is created when at least two people [stake](/what-is-odyssey/roadmap/#staking) in the same Odyssey
- **Wisp**. The ball of light you fly through and explore Odysseys with
- **Connect to Odyssey**. Contribute to an Odyssey by staking an amount of $MOM tokens and collect rewards 
- **Journey**. Your experience inside an Odyssey

## Functionality
Let's see some of the main functionalities at your disposal.

### Odyssey Creator (World builder mode)
The Odyssey Creator is the core process which enables you to build your Odyssey. By switching on world builder mode, you can create and edit objects in your Odyssey, as well as change world parameters.  We've added a few primitives for you to play around with (and some surprises!), but you can also upload your own objects in GLB format.

Once you have created an object, you can freely re-size/move/scale it in your Odyssey, you can also assign functionalities to be triggered when the object is clicked on—be it displaying an image, opening a Miro or even streaming YouTube content!

### Connect to Odyssey/Staking
In Odyssey you connect to other Odyssey by staking into them. Our staking flow is very easy to follow and allows you to easily and quickly stake $MOM to other Odysseys. Connecting (staking) brings you rewards and will unlock new features for you in the upcoming versions! More info about [staking](/what-is-odyssey/roadmap/#staking).

### Portals
Any object created while in World builder mode can be assigned Portal functionality. A portal allows you to create a shortcut to another Odyssey—meaning that visitors can explore multiple worlds without using the 'Explore' screen.

### Docking
When you've staked in another users Odyssey, and if they return the favour and stake back in yours, then a docking bulb is added to the docking station. This acts as a permanent connection between two Odysseys, showing mutual support. 

### Fly to me
Being inside someone's Odyssey can be overwhelming sometimes, hence we introduced a "Fly to me" option - you can ask the Odyssey creator or an admin to trigger "Fly to me" and give you a tour showing you around the Odyssey. Every Odyssey creator and admin can trigger "Fly to me" at any point and invite all visitors to their Odyssey to fly to their positions. Remember, every visitor has the option to accept or decline your invitation!

### Socials
It is critical to be able to communicate with other users and this why we have Socials. The Socials panel provides you with the opportunity to communicate via a text chat or even join a voice chat with other people exploring the Odyssey. You can find the Socials panel inside each Odyssey and chat is Odyssey specific.

### Navigation/Minimap
The Navigation panel is an opportunity to explore the Odyssey you are into in a fun and interactive way! You can search on the Navigation panel for specific objects or just drag your mouse around the map to see the different objects inside the Odyssey. Bonus points if you double-click an object you fly to it automagically! With the navigation panel you will never get lost inside an Odyssey it will always show your position!
