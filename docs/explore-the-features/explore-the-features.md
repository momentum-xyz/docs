Before you dive deeper into Odyssey and the features there are some main concepts you need to be familiar with:

- *Odyssey*. This is your inner world representation in the metaverse
- *Odyssey Creator*. It's your source of power, you will head hear anytime you want to add something to your Odyssey
- *Objects*. These are the assets that make up your Odyssey, we give you some to get started with, but you can also import your own!
- *Joint Odysseys*. A Joint Odyssey is created when at least two people [stake](/what-is-odyssey/roadmap/#staking) in the same Odyssey
- *Wisp*. The ball of light you fly through and explore Odysseys with
- *Connect to Odyssey*. Contribute to an Odyssey by staking an amount of $MOM tokens and collect rewards 
- *Journey*. Your experience inside of an Odyseey


### Odyssey Creator/World Builder Mode

The Odyssey Creator is the core process which enables you to build your Odyssey. By switching on world builder mode, you can create and edit objects in your Oddyssey - as well as change world parameters.  We've added a few primatives for you to play around with (and some surprises!), but you can also upload your own objects in GLB format.

Once you have created an object, you can freely re-size/move/scale it in your Odyssey, you can also assign functionalities to be triggered when the object is clicked on - be it displaying an image, opening a Miro or even streaming Youtube content!
