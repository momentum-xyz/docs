## Terminology

- **Wisp**. The ball of light you fly through and explore Odysseys with

- **Journey**. Your experience inside an Odyssey

## Functionality
Let's see what functionality is at your disposal.

### Odyssey Creator (World builder mode)

The Odyssey Creator is the core process which enables you to build your Odyssey. By switching on world builder mode, you can create and edit objects in your Odyssey, as well as change world parameters.  We've added a few primitives for you to play around with (and some surprises!), but you can also upload your own objects in GLB format.

Once you have created an object, you can freely re-size/move/scale it in your Odyssey, you can also assign functionalities to be triggered when the object is clicked onâ€”be it displaying an image, opening a Miro or even streaming YouTube content!
