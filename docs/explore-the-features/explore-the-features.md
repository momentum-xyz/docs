In this section we give an overview of all the feature you can use to create and co-create your unique, epic Odyssey.

## Building your Odyssey

Creating your Odyssey means minting your own 3D world (call it metaverse, if you like) on the blockchain. Right now, Odyssey is in alpha on testnet, but if you own an odyssey NFT you can already build your own world and experience some of its features. Some of the things you can start building with are: 

- Basic shapes that can be wrapped with images and colours
- Upload custom glb files into your world 
- Change the skybox of your world
- Add text and videos onto your objects (beta)
- Move and edit objects using a universal gizmo
