To offer an amazing experience, it's not enough to crowd your Odyssey with pretty objects. Let's see how to make them do thing!

:::info
As of now, only [default primitives](spawning-assets.mdx#spawning-a-default-object) can be assigned functionalities. We are working on making the tool available for custom objects as well. 
:::

## Available functionalities

There are the functionality that you can currently assign to objects:

- **Text**. Opens a multi-line text frame. You could, for example, include the story behind an NFT and add the link to the marketplace where people can get it
- **Image**. Wrap basic assets such as cubes with textures. If you assign an image to an object, then you can assign it any other functionality on top of that
- **Video**. Clicking on the object open a YouTube, Vimeo, or Twitch video frame
- **Miro**. Clicking on the objects opens a Miro board
- **Google Drive**. Clicking on the object opens a Google document (work with Docs, Sheets, and Slidesâ€¦ you could literally give a presentation from your Odyssey)

## How to assign a functionality to an object

In this example we will wrap a default cube with a custom image.

:::tip
The same image will be repeated on all the faces of the object
:::

1. Enter [Creator mode](enter-creator-mode.md)
2. Click on the object you want to assign a functionality to
3. Choose `Functionality` from the horizontal menu on top of the object
4. Choose `Image` from the drop-down menu on the top-left (or any other functionality)
5. Exit Creator mode by clicking on the `X` in the bottom-right corner
6. Click on the object again, then on `Chenge image`, and finally on `Select image`
7. Choose your image and click on `Change`

You should now see your object wrapped in that image.

:::tip
ðŸŒ‹ **Lava-hot tip**: If you wrap an object in an image and then assign it another functionality (for example *video*), it will keep the image wrapping. This is particularly useful if you want to give a hint of what happens if the user clicks on an object.

## Change an object's functionality

To change the functionality of an object, the process is exactly the same as assigning it. As mentioned above, keep in mind that if you have assigned an image to the object, that image will be kept even after you change the functionality of the asset. Here is a quick gif that shows how it works.
