To offer an amazing experience, it's not enough to crowd your Odyssey with pretty objects. Let's see how to make them do thing!

:::info
As of now, only default primitives can be assigned functionalities. We are working on making the tool available for custom objects as well.
:::

## Available functionalities

There are the functionality that you can currently assign to objects:

- **Text**. Opens a multi-line text frame. You could, for example, include the story behind an NFT and add the link to the marketplace where people can get it
- **Image**. Wrap basic assets such as cubes with textures. If you assign an image to an object, then you can assign it any other functionality on top of that
- **Video**. Clicking on the object open a YouTube video frame

## How to assign a functionality to an object

In this example we will wrap a default cube with a custom image.


:::tip
The same image will be repeated on all the faces of the object
:::

1. Enter Creator mode
2. Click on the object you want to assign a functionality to
3. Choose Functionality (3 stacked cubes icon) from the Toolbar along the bottom
4. Choose Image from the menu on the top-right of the new UI panel (or any other functionality)
5. In the case of images; upload your image and give it a name. In the case of text, write your text and give it a header, and in the case of a youtube video; simply paste the link to the video and give it a name. In this example we will upload an image to a cube.
6. The press on the embed button to embed your image onto the cube
7. Give the system a moment to load and the image should appear wrapped around the cube. 

To interact with the functionalities embedded onto objects; you must leave the odyssey creator mode and then select on the objects. Only then will the text and or videos appear in a ui tab; as otherwise when you select that object inside the creator mode; the gizmo will display. 


:::tip
ðŸŒ‹ **Lava-hot tip**: If you wrap an object in an image and then assign it another functionality (for example *video*), it will keep the image wrapping. This is particularly useful if you want to give a hint of what happens if the user clicks on an object.
