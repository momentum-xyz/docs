Objects are no good unless you can place them exactly how you want and make them as big as you want. In this section we'll show you exactly how to do that.

## Moving an object

The moving gizmo is the first tool you see when you enter [creator mode](enter-creator-mode.md) and click on an object. `Click and drag` on the handles to change the positioning of your objects.

## Rotating an object

The beauty of 3D objects is that you can view them from many angles. Rotating assets helps you get just the look you want. To rotate an object:

1. Enter Creator mode
2. Click on the object you want to rotate
3. Select the `Rotate` option
4. `Click and drag` the red, green, and blue circles to rotate your asset (each circle will rotate the object on a different axis)

## Scaling an object

What if you want something to be bigger? Sometimes you just need it one size larger...

Anyway, here is how to get objects to a massive scale (or micro, whatever floats your boat ðŸš¢) in your Odyssey:

1. Enter Creator mode
2. Click on the object you want to rotate
3. Select the `Scale` option
4. `Click and drag` the coloured handles to scale the relative axis, or do the same to the white cube in the middle to scale all axis at the same time

**ðŸŒ‹ Lava-hot tip:** With all gizmos, the selected axis will turn yellow when you hover over it, so you'll know which one is selected, and you can start dragging to modify your object.
