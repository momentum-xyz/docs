In Odyssey there are two types of objects: the default ‘wrappable object’ shapes we put at your disposal, and your own custom assets. Let's see how to place them in your Odyssey. We'll start with the default shapes, because they are easier to handle.

First of all... what the heck is spawning? It's just a fancy term for "placing", just like primitive is a fancy term for "simple object".

## Spawning a default object

To get you started, we give you some default shapes (cones, cubes, spheres, etc.) that you can place in your Odyssey. To add one of these objects follow these steps:

1. Enter Experience Creator mode by pressing the pencil button from the centre of the toolbar along the bottom
2. Click on the ‘Add Object’ ‘+’ (plus) button on the top right of your screen
3. Choose your object from the Community Library Pack. At the top of the community object library you will see the wrappable asset pack; consisting of 12 wrappable shapes that can be placed in your world. Select any one of these shapes (for example the cube with image) to spawn this object in your world. 
4. Once you have clicked on an object you will see more details about the object; such as who uploaded it; when it was added and who created it. This information is more relevant for custom objects that have been added to the library; but we will get to that later. For now give your object a name and select spawn object.
5. You will see a holographic transparent ghost version of the cube before you. This ghostly object will follow you enabling you to fly the object to where you want to place it. Once you are happy with its location; press the tick mark along the toolbar in the centre bottom of your screen. 
6. You have no successfully spawned an object in your world. Congratulations!

## Spawning a custom object

There are a few more steps to place a custom object in your Odyssey. Let's go through them together.

1. Enter Experience Creator mode by pressing the pencil button from the centre of the toolbar along the bottom
2. Click on the ‘Add Object’ ‘+’ (plus) button on the top right of your screen
3. On these screen; now press the “upload custom object’ button on the UI
4. Once you have clicked on upload custom object; you will be asked to upload your custom object; either by dragging and dropping your file or by using the button to upload your file. Once your file is uploaded your will see a preview of it. You then need to name your object and may also give a name for the artists of the object. 
The user may select if they want this object to be available for public use of just for their own private library (private library is an under construction feature and not available yet)
Once you have named it you can press the button that says publish; this will put your custom object into the community library. 
5. Once you have published your file; you must select it from the community object library and spawn it using the same flow as described above. You can find your object either by scrolling for it or by using the search function. Select your object to proceed
6. Once you have clicked your custom object you will see more details about the object; such as who uploaded it (you); when it was added and who created it. For now give your object a name and select spawn object. 
7. You will see a holographic transparent ghost version of the cube before you. This ghostly object will follow you enabling you to fly the object to where you want to place it. Once you are happy with its location; press the tick mark along the toolbar in the centre bottom of your screen. 
8. You have no successfully spawned an object in your world. Congratulations!

We put together a few resources on where to find free 3D assets, and how to convert them into the right format, in [this article](https://discover.odyssey.org/blog/quick-guide-to-3d-assets-for-your-odyssey/)

:::warning
It is important to consider how complex a model is when you upload it into your Odyssey. There are two important aspects that make a model complex: **file size** and **polycount**.

**File size** is the size in megabytes of the model—remember, everyone who logs into your odyssey will need to download the model. Though you can upload models up to 50mb in size, we recommend that you keep models under 10mb for better performance. Keep in mind that model sizes add up: if you have 20 different 10mb models, visitors will need to download 200mb of information before they can enter your Odyssey!

**Polycount** is the structural complexity of the model (how many triangles it is made of). The more triangles, the more complicated it is for a browser to display the model. Anything under 100,000 triangles should be fine to use.

When looking for assets online, look for ‘game-ready’ assets that have been built with a low polycount and file size.
