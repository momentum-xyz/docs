The skybox is the visible background of your Odyssey and allows you to set a unique vibe in your 3D world. We give users access to a set of default skyboxes; as well as enable the users to upload their own skyboxes. 

Community and private skybox libraries are being developed and will come soon/

## How to change the skybox

1. Enter Experience Creator mode by pressing the pencil button from the centre of the toolbar along the bottom
2. Click on the ‘change skybox’ button on the top right of your screen
3. Choose one of the six skyboxes from the Odyssey library inside the Community Library. 
4. Once you have clicked on a skybox you will see more details about the skybox; such as who uploaded it; when it was added and who created it. This information is more relevant for custom skyboxes that have been added to the library; but we will get to that later. For now simply press the ‘Change skybox’ button. 
5. Wait a moment for the system to process your change, and then you wil lsee your new skybox displayed in your world. Congratulations! 

## How to upload a custom skybox

There are a few more steps to place a custom object in your Odyssey. Let's go through them together. 

1. Enter Experience Creator mode by pressing the pencil button from the centre of the toolbar along the bottom
2. Click on the ‘change skybox’ button on the top right of your screen
3. Select the upload custom skybox button from the skyboxes UI panel.
On this screen you can upload your custom skybox. There are a couple of guidelines for your image to have the ideal skybox. Your image must be a 360-degree image. This will allow your skybox to fully surround and immerse you in your world. To avoid any pixelation or distortion, we recommend that your image is high-resolution. Our preferred resolution for images is 4k x 2k, but 2k x 1k is acceptable.

## Remove a skybox

You can also remove skyboxes you don't need anymore:

1. Enter [Creator mode]
2. Click on the `skybox` button (it's the first one from the top in the tools panel on the left)
3. Click on the `Bin` icon in the top-right corner of the skybox you want to delete, and confirm your choice. Note that you cannot delete the default skybox (Odysseynebula) or the active skybox
