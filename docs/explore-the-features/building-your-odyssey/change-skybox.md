The skybox is the background of your Odyssey and allows you to set a unique vibe in your 3D world.

## How to change the skybox

1. Enter [Creator mode](enter-creator-mode.md)
2. Click on the `skybox` button (it's the first one from the top in the tools panel on the left)
3. Choose `Add skybox`
4. Upload your 360 image (we recommend it's at least 4000x2000 pixels, but 2000x1000 should be fine as well), and click on `Add skybox`
5. Wait for the image to be loaded (it might take a little depending on your internet speed, but you will get a notification in the bottom-right corner)
6. The new skybox will automatically be leaded in your Odyssey, you can close `Close panel` and keep building!

## Remove a skybox

You can also remove skyboxes you don't need anymore:

1. Enter [Creator mode](enter-creator-mode.md)
2. Click on the `skybox` button (it's the first one from the top in the tools panel on the left)
3. Click on the `Bin` icon in the top-right corner of the skybox you want to delete, and confirm your choice. Note that you cannot delete the default skybox (Odysseynebula) or the active skybox
