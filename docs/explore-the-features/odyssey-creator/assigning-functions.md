To offer an amazing experience, it's not enough to crowd your Odyssey with pretty objects. Let's see how to make them do thing!

:::info
As of now, only [default primitives](spawning-assets.mdx#spawning-a-default-object) can be assigned functions. We are working on making the tool available for custom objects as well.

## How to assign a function to an object

In this example we will wrap a default cube with a custom image.

:::tip
The same image will be repeated on all the faces of the object
:::

1. Enter [Creator mode](enter-creator-mode.md)
2. Click on the object you want to assign a function to
3. Choose `Functionality` from the horizontal menu on top of the object
4. Choose `Image` from the drop-down menu on the top-left (or any other function)
5. Exit Creator mode by clicking on the `X` in the bottom-right corner
6. Click on the object again, then on `Chenge image`, and finally on `Select image`
7. Choose your image and click on `Change`

You should now see your object wrapped in that image.

:::tip
ðŸŒ‹ **Lava-hot tip**: If you wrap an object in an image and then assign it another function (for example *video*), it will keep the image wrapping. This is particularly useful if you want to give a hint of what happens if the user clicks on an object.

## Change an object's function

To change the functionality of an object, the process is exactly the same as assigning it. As mentioned above, keep in mind that if you have assigned an image to the object, that image will be kept even after you change the functionality of the asset. Here is a quick gif that shows how it works.
