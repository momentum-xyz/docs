The skybox is the background of your Odyssey, and controls not only the backdrop image, but also the lighting and how it affects the assets in your Odyssey.

## How to change the skybox

2. Click on the `skybox` button (it's the first one from the top in the tools panel on the left)
3. Choose your new skybox and click `Select skybox`, then close the panel, and you are done
