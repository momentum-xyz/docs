## Available plugins
The Odyssey team is always looking for new functionality to offer. Here's what's available right now
### Miro
Embed your miro boards, so people can contribute to your project, or just see where things are going.
### Google Drive
Embed any Google document (text, spreadsheet, or presentation) in your Odyssey. Go nuts!
### iFrames
We should really just drop the mic here. Embed in your Odyssey your website, or any other iFrame-supporting resource.
