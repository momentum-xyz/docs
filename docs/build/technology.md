This document provides a quick high level overview of the architecture and system behind Odyssey that we hope to be building with you. This is a living document that will be updated and expanded, so keep and eye on it!

# FRONT-END

Our front-end system is powered by React and Babylon.js Javascript frameworks. Being optimised specifically for the browser, it delivers real time 3D visuals and interactive user interfaces.

# BACK-END

This stack powers real-time updates, blockchain integration, and collaborative building between users. The back-end updates the positions of other users and objects in real-time, providing blockchain integration and synchronises with the Ethereum and Polygon blockchains. Our API provides a fast and efficient mechanism for larger data amounts.
