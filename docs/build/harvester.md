This document provides a high level overview of the architecture and system behind Odyssey that we hope to be building with you. This is a living document that will be updated and expanded, so keep and eye on it!

#  Introduction
At Odyssey, the blockchain is used to store the data about the ownership and the relationships between the users and the Odysseys (3D worlds).

Ownership is stored in the form of ERC721 tokens, that are non-fungible tokens (NFT), which means that each token is unique and can be identified by its ID. The NFT is owned by the user's wallet address.

The Harvesters job is to keep track of balances and transactions of tokens between wallets.
