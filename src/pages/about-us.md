Odyssey is an [antifragile](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antifragility) company. We thrive in response to crises.

We started off by organising physical hackathons, and we created the biggest in Europe, where we got thousands of people from all over the world to travel to the Dutch countryside and work out solutions to real-world problems in an abandoned sugar refinery.

Then the pandemic hit, and we realised that no tool out there was good enough to host a hackathon. In response to this, we built our own: a 3D world that would become the ultimate collaboration platform. We called it Momentum.

We refined Momentum together with some big partners, and then we executed yet another pivot: we transitioned to a decentralised Web 3.0 ecosystem and joined the Dotsama community.

Web 3.0 taught us that creators, artists, and everyone looking for am uncompromising expression medium are in dire need for something new that they can really own. Web 2.0 technologies aren't cutting it. So we decided to pivot again, took everything we learned from Momentum and closed the circle: Odyssey, reborn from its ashes, is now the place where our imaginations meet to create together, connect, and tokenise adventures, quests, and journeys.
