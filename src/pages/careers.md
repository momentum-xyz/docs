## Working at Odyssey
Odyssey provides a home for passionate people who have signed up on the mission of networked collaboration, web3, and the Metaverse. Work remote without ever feeling remotely on your own while having fun together (think game nights, hackathons and memes!). But most importantly you get to fly in Momentum every day. Who wouldn't want that?
